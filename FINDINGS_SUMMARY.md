# Security Audit Findings - Quick Summary

## üéØ What Was Found

This security audit discovered **hardcoded API keys and sensitive information** in your repository that are publicly visible on GitHub.

---

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Exposed API Key

**Found:** Lyzr API Key  
**Value:** `sk-default-0vXAp7xlIsAZ7Ocktmowe7DicKqNQGc0`  
**Risk:** Anyone can use this key to access your Lyzr AI account

### Where It's Located:
1. `src/lib/lyzr.ts` - Line 14
2. `test-agents.js` - Line 13  
3. `test-agents-standalone.js` - Lines 13 and 298

### What You Must Do:
1. **REVOKE THIS KEY IMMEDIATELY** in your Lyzr dashboard
2. Generate a new API key
3. Add it to `.env.local` (not tracked by Git)
4. Update code to use `process.env.LYZR_API_KEY`

---

## üü° MEDIUM: Exposed Email Address

**Found:** Personal email  
**Value:** `akash.c@goml.io`  
**Risk:** Privacy violation, potential spam/phishing target

### Where It's Located:
1. `src/lib/lyzr.ts` - Line 15
2. `test-agents.js` - Line 14
3. `test-agents-standalone.js` - Lines 14 and 299

### What You Should Do:
1. Remove hardcoded email from code
2. Use environment variable instead
3. Add `LYZR_USER_ID` to `.env.local`

---

## üü¢ LOW: Agent IDs

**Found:** Lyzr agent identifiers  
**Risk:** Minor - reveals system architecture

### Where Located:
- `src/lib/lyzr.ts` - Lines 7-11
- `test-agents.js` - Lines 15-19
- `test-agents-standalone.js` - Lines 15-19

### What You Could Do:
- Consider moving to environment variables (optional)

---

## ‚úÖ What's Already Good

1. **`.gitignore` is properly configured** - `.env*` files are excluded ‚úÖ
2. **No `.env` files are committed** - Good practice ‚úÖ
3. **Environment validation exists** - Code checks for placeholders ‚úÖ
4. **Mock data fallback** - App works without real credentials ‚úÖ

---

## üìã Quick Action Plan

### Today (15 minutes):
1. Go to Lyzr dashboard ‚Üí Revoke key `sk-default-...`
2. Generate new key
3. Create `.env.local` and add:
   ```env
   LYZR_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   LYZR_USER_ID=your_email@example.com
   ```

### This Week (30 minutes):
4. Fix `src/lib/lyzr.ts` (remove hardcoded values)
5. Fix `test-agents.js` (remove hardcoded values)
6. Fix `test-agents-standalone.js` (remove hardcoded values)
7. Test that everything still works
8. Commit and push changes

### Optional (Later):
9. Clean Git history to remove old keys
10. Set up automated security scanning
11. Implement key rotation policy

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Why This Matters

- **Cost:** Someone could use your API key and you'd be charged
- **Privacy:** Your email is publicly exposed
- **Security:** Exposed credentials can lead to data breaches
- **Compliance:** May violate data protection regulations
- **Reputation:** Professional projects should never expose credentials

## ü§î Questions?

**Q: Is my GitHub repo public?**  
A: If these keys are in your repo, assume they're compromised regardless of public/private status.

**Q: How did this happen?**  
A: Likely hardcoded for testing/development and accidentally committed.

**Q: Do I need to force-push/rewrite history?**  
A: Recommended but not required. The most important step is revoking the old key.

**Q: Will my app stop working?**  
A: Temporarily, until you add the new key to `.env.local` and update the code.

**Q: Can you fix it for me?**  
A: We've provided all the documentation, but the code changes need to be made by someone with access to generate a new API key.
